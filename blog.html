    <h1 class="mt-4">Web Development</h1>
    <p class="mt-4 display-6 p-5 text-dark">
      Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
      Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web
      development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
      text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social
      network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
      development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web
      content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
      Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

    <p class="mt-4 display-6 p-5 text-dark">
      Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user
      interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so
      that users can view and interact with that website.

        <div class="h2 ms-3">Hyper Text Markup Language</div>
        <p class="mt-4 p-5 text-danger">
          HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website
          development process, without which a web page does not exist.
          Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in
          it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it
          will bring another web-page. A markup language indicates text can be
          turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is
          the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will
          look. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of
          HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3C
          recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of
          handling elements such as video and audio files.

        <div class="h2 ms-3">Cascading stylesheet</div>
        <p class="mt-4 p-5 text-danger">
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the
          site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does this by
          maintaining style sheets that sit on top of other style rules and are
          triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and
          resolution. The CSS can be added externally, internally, or embedded
          in the HTML tags.
        </p>

      <div class="border border-5 border-dark mt-4">
        <div class="h2 ms-3">JavaScript</div>
        <p class="mt-4 p-5 text-danger">
          JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as
          opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to
          transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code
          can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML
          standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user
          input. Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also
          actively retrieve content from the web (independent of the original
          HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well,
          adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience.
